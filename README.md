# star-wars-quiz

## Description

The creation of this project was to showcase work samples as well as introduce a little about me for potential employers. Core skills that were used while creating this project were media queries, CSS variables, and flexbox. Media queries were used to resize and adapt certain parts of the page depending on the screen size it is shown in. CSS variables were used to show when values were reused throughout the code multiple times, for example in colors used throughout the code. The flex box is used to design a flexible container layout that arranges items in rows or columns either expanding or shrinking in space to fill or fit in the container.
